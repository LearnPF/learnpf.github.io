# Guide to Crossfire (cross)

In Public Forum Debate, there are **three** crossfires. The first crossfire takes place directly after each team delivers their constructive speech (1st cross), the second crossfire takes place after each team delivers their rebuttal speech (2nd cross) and the third crossfire occurs after the summary speech (grand cross). 

The goal for each speaker in crossfire is to prove why their opponent's case is lacking. For instance, if an opponent's source is sketchy, the debater should aim to "poke" holes in the opponents argument. 

There are some guiding rules to consider when you participate in crossfire. You must strictly follow the rules below as you may be dropped (or lose the round) solely for bad behavior. 

 - NEVER talk over your opponent or be rude
 - Don’t say anything sexist, racist, homophobic, ableist, etc
 - Don’t make up evidence or blatantly lie
 - Belittling your opponents
 - **AND DO NOT YELL**


Some extra tips: 
 - Sound confident 
 - Maintain your perceptual dominance
 - Speak Clearly/Be assertive
 - Don’t pass on questions
 - REMEMBER: Aggression is not dominance
 - DON’T talk about issues you are losing
 - Press your opponents on specifics
 - Make their arguments seem silly, press for examples or just simply how things work
