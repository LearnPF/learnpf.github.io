To make a Debate case, or at least Debate a simple topic, you must be able to research. Although searching the web may seem like a daunting - or even, impossible, task, there are a couple of resources online to make this job easier. 


First, when onefirst  receives the topic, it helps to do a quick overview of what the topic is. Usually, videos or short articles can be great places to start when researching background information. Moreover, if you have the means of acquiring them, try to look at what are called Briefs (DebateUS, Champions, DebateTrack, etc.). These pamphlets of information are very helpful in developing ideas for arguments and contain solid evidence. 




There are plenty of helpful websites which I have compiled below to make your job as a Debater easier (websites which are bolded are very helpful)
