# Final Focus 


Final Focus is the last speech we give in the round. It is an opportunity for you to give your final arguments to the judge and push your team over the edge. In Final Focus, we want to give a quick snapshot of the round that portrays your team in a favorable lens. Remember, Final Focus is only two minutes long, so you don’t have much time to speak. However, following the template below can help make the second speaker’s job much easier. 


- Go to the opponent’s case  - but only what they extend (If the opponent’s don’t extend on certain contentions, they drop those arguments. Unless **your team** gains offensive value from those arguments, addressing them is simply a waste of time). Restate their contentions (signposting!) and your responses to them. 
- Go to your case, and frontline your opponent’s responses. 
- Weigh! 


Extra Tips: Throughout the Final Focus, it helps to use Ballot Directive Language (things such as “we win because” or “you’re going to vote (pro/neg) today). This helps to strengthen your case to the judge.
