# Adapting to Judges

## Types of Judges: 

When Debating on the National (and local!) circuit, adapting to the judge is arguably the most crucial aspect of Debate. Each judge has their own stylistic preference, and it is likely that they will vote based on who **they** think Debated the best. 

Hence, because it is the judge who makes the eventual decision on who wins and loses, Debaters must adapt their style to the judge - not on how they like to Debate. Fortunately, there are well-established tricks and tips which make doing so pretty simple. 

First, we must understand some Debate jargon as defined below: 

- **Lay Judge:** When one refers to a lay judge, it means someone with less experience. They are usually parents of Debaters and often do not have prior knowledge on the topic. They usually do not flow and tend to vote based on the last two speeches (summary and final focus). 
- **Tech Judge:** Tech Judges are usually former Debaters or coaches. They usually have extensive knowledge of Debate and are flow the round. They may be able to understand more progressive arguments (theory, Ks, etc.). 
- **Flay Judge:** A Flay judge is a mix between a Tech and a Lay Judge. These judges may flow, and may have some prior knowledge of the topic. 

## How to determine what type of judge you have: 

On the National Circuit, Tournaments use a tool called Tabroom. On this online platform you are able to see your rounds, opponents and most importantly - judge. Many judges have what is called a "paradigm." This file tells you the judge's preferences, and often may indicate their prior experience. Let's look at some paradigms to determine what type of judge each person is.
