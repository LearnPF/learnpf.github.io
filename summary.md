# The Summary 


The summary is essentially the closing argument of the round. In the summary, we tell the judge why they should vote for us. The structure of the summary should be as follows: 


- Summarize our main points (the reasons why we win)
- Explain our responses to our opponents case
- Weigh 


It is important to note that when we summarize our main points, we do something called collapsing. When we collapse, we essentially narrow down the round to focus on one or two main arguments (preferably one of your contentions). Strategically, these should be arguments which either do not have many responses or are easy to weigh on. Remember: DON’T GO FOR EVERY CONTENTION. 


When we collapse, we should do the following: 


- Extend the argument. 
- Explain why the opponent’s responses to the argument are false.
- Weigh the argument (why is your impact more important compared to the opponents?)


Let’s break down each of these steps: 


- Extending the argument: When we extend the argument, we first name the argument (the reason you are voting for (pro/neg) is because of our Contention on [insert argument here]). After we name the argument, we explain the argument. When we explain the argument, we tell the judge our link, uniqueness and warrant. Sometimes, it may help to write extensions to your arguments before the round. This makes the 2nd Speaker’s job much easier especially when it comes to the impromptu aspect of the speech. 

- Explaining the opponent’s responses: In this step of the summary, we should explain the opponent’s responses, but more specifically, explain why the opponent’s responses are incorrect. If you spoke first, your partner should have frontlined in rebuttal, but you should briefly explain what your partner said. If you’re second speaker you have the job of frontlining, but again make sure not to 

- Weigh the argument: Again, weighing is a comparative analysis between two different arguments. Explain to the judge why your argument matters more than theirs.

Make sure that the summary mirrors the final focus! Don’t change your end of round structure. If you extend one argument in summary EXTEND THAT SAME argument in Final Focus. If not, the round is going to be very disorganized, and the judge will often take the easiest path to the ballot (which is likely the opponents). Also, make sure to not bring up any new material. By this point, it is arguably too late to make a new argument or response. Many judges will not take into consideration these arguments if they are brought up too late.
